# Murgicraft fork of Pumpkin

This is a fork of [Pumpkin](https://github.com/Pumpkin-MC/Pumpkin) maintained for the Murgicraft server. It tracks upstream `master` and adds fixes aimed at running a survival server: redstone, combat, world generation, commands and the plugin API.

## How the code here is written

The changes in this fork are written by AI coding agents, not by hand. The fork owner tests them in-game but does not review the code line by line. Treat every commit that isn't from upstream accordingly.

Each change is still held to upstream's [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) rules: it is ported from the decompiled vanilla source, stays one topic per commit, passes `cargo fmt`, `clippy` and the tests, and comes with a regression test where one can catch the bug. That keeps the commits small enough for upstream to take any of them if they want to.

None of this is sent upstream as pull requests. Upstream maintainers are welcome to cherry-pick anything they find useful.

## Staying in sync

Upstream is merged in regularly. When upstream fixes something this fork also fixed, the fork drops its own version and keeps upstream's.
